Project summary
In this project I use an Airbnb dataset of nightly rental prices in March 2017 that includes information on the price and various apartment features as well as information on hosts.
Dataset covers Greater London and has 51646 observations.
Dataset can be accessed from "https://gabors-data-analysis.com/datasets/#airbnb"
In my analysis I have limited my attention to private room rentals on apartments in London city with hosts that are superhost, has profile picture, and are phone&email&facebook verified.
I use Stata to analyze and edit the dataset for the needs of my analysis.

To redo the analysis, simply use the " master.do " on Stata.
